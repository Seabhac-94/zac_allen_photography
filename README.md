# Zac Allen Photography
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
<br>
For my first milestone project, I created a portfolio website for my photography.
<br>
This website includes a landing page, a gallery, with links to three other galleries, and a contact page.
## Demo
A live demo can be found here @ https://seabhac-94.github.io/zac_allen_photography/
## UX
The main goal of this website was to create a user friendly photography portfolio page where potential buyers could come and view work.
### Landing Page
It was decided early on, that the landing page would be a simple hero image and text, with links to other pages in the navbar.
### Gallery
Using a little bit of text to describe how each type of photography came about, a 3 part gallery page was formed with links to Still Life, Natural Habitat and Landscape galleries.
### Contact
For the contact page, the same format as the gallery page was followed. The contact form code was taken from the "Resume Project-Code Institute" and modified to fit the needs of the page.
### Further Design Considerations
The background shouldn't take away from the main content of the page so an off-white color was used for the background. The main focus should be on the photos themselves and backgrounds shouldn't take away form the conent.
## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

## Features
This page uses a carousel feature found in bootsrap, and modal feature found in bootstrap.
## Testing
This website was tested on my multiple devices, such as iPhone 6S, Galaxy J5, Apple Macbook Pro, Apple iPad and Sony Laptop for responsitivity between different devices.
## Deployment
The live site is deployed on GitHub pages. It uses the master branch. It updates each time there is a new push to the repository.
## Credits
#### Content

#### Photos
All photos are the personal work of Zac Allen and were taken thorughout time on various cameras ranging from Canon AdvancedPowershot to Canon400D.
