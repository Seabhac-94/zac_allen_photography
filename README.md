# Zac Allen Photography
Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute
<br>
For my first milestone project, I created a portfolio website for my photography.
<br>
This website includes a landing page, a gallery, with links to three other galleries, and a contact page.
## Demo
A live demo can be found here @ https://seabhac-94.github.io/zac_allen_photography/
## UX
My main goal of this website was to create a user friendly photography portfolio page where potential buyers could come and view work.
### Landing Page
I decided early on, that my landing page would be a simple hero image and text, with links to other pages in the navbar.
### Gallery
Using a little bit of text to describe how I came to be interested in each type of photography, I formed a 3 part gallery page with links to Still Life, Natural Habitat and Landscape galleries.
### Contact
For my contact page, I followed the same format as the gallery page. The contact form code was taken from the "Resume Project-Code Institute" and modified to fit the needs of the page.
## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

## Features
This page uses a carousel feature found in bootsrap, and modal feature found in bootstrap.
## Testing
This website was tested on my multiple devices, such as iPhone 6S, Galaxy J5, Apple Macbook Pro, Apple iPad and Sony Laptop.
## Deployment
The live site is deployed on GitHub pages. It uses the master branch. It updates each time there is a new push to the repository.
## Credits
#### Content
All content in Gallery and Contact was written by me.
#### Photos
All photos are my own personal work and were taken by me thorughout my life on various cameras ranging from Canon AdvancedPowershot to Canon400D.
## Acknowledgements
As mentioned above, I used carousel and modals from bootstrap.
